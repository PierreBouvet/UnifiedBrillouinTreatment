# Unified Brillouin Treatment User Interface

## Introduction to the project

This project aims at proposing a standard interface to store and treat Brillouin Scattered spectra, particularly to be used by the BioBrillouin community. As such this User Interface has two goals
- Allow an easy conversion of spectra to a standardized BH5 format
- Standardize the treatment of Brillouin spectra with optimized algorithms

## Setting up

To test the User Interface, you should open the main.py file and run it.
